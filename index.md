# Privacy Policy for FaithTrack

*Last Updated: May 2, 2025*

## Introduction

Welcome to FaithTrack. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, protect, and share your information when you use our FaithTrack application (the "App").

## Who We Are

FaithTrack is developed and maintained by an independent developer, Matthew Barber. If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us at matthewfbarber@gmail.com.

## Information We Collect

We collect information to provide and improve the App, understand usage patterns, and measure the effectiveness of our outreach.

### Information You Provide to Us

When you use FaithTrack, we may collect:

- User identification information (User ID generated by Firebase)
- Email address (when you sign up or use Google Sign-In)
- Display name (if you choose to provide one)
- Google Sign-In information (if you use Google Sign-In for authentication)
- Your preferences and settings within the App

### Information Collected Automatically

When you use our App, we and our third-party service providers may automatically collect certain information, including:

- **Usage Data**: Progress data related to your completed sessions and modules, module subscription information, features you use, frequency of use, and other interaction data within the App.
- **Device Information**: Information about the device you use to access the App, such as device model, operating system version, IP address, and unique device identifiers (collected via Firebase and other SDKs).
- **Log Data**: Information related to your use of the App, such as crash logs, performance data, and general app activity (collected via Firebase).
- **Advertising & Analytics Data**: Information used for advertising measurement and analytics purposes, collected via third-party SDKs (see "Tracking Technologies" below). This may include:
  - Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), only if you grant permission via the App Tracking Transparency prompt.
  - Information about app installs attributed to advertising campaigns.
  - Interactions with certain features used for analytics or ad measurement.

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information for the following purposes:

- To authenticate your identity and provide you access to the App.
- To track your progress and manage your subscriptions within the App.
- To personalize your experience based on your preferences and usage.
- To maintain, operate, and improve the App's functionality and performance.
- To analyze usage patterns to understand how the App is used and enhance user experience.
- To measure the effectiveness of advertising campaigns and attribute app installs to specific ads (e.g., on Facebook, TikTok, Google).
- To perform analytics to better understand our user base for marketing and product development purposes.
- To communicate important updates or information about the App.
- To detect, prevent, and address technical issues or security concerns.
- To comply with legal obligations.

## Data Storage and Security

Your core account data (User ID, email, progress, etc.) is stored using Google Firebase services (Firebase Authentication and Firestore), which employ industry-standard security protocols like data encryption and secure authentication methods.

We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal information against unauthorized access, accidental loss, or damage. However, please note that no method of transmission over the Internet or electronic storage is 100% secure.

For more information about Firebase's security practices, visit Firebase Security Documentation. Data collected by other third-party SDKs is stored according to their respective security practices (see "Third-Party Services & Data Sharing").

## Third-Party Services & Data Sharing

We utilize third-party services to operate the App and understand its usage. We may share certain information with these providers as described below. We do not sell your personal information.

- **Google Firebase**: Provides our backend infrastructure, including authentication, database (Firestore), and core analytics (Firebase Analytics). We share necessary account and usage data with Firebase to enable these functions.
- **Advertising Partners** (Facebook/Meta, TikTok, Google Ads): We use SDKs from these platforms to track app installs originating from advertisements run on their networks and to measure the performance of our advertising campaigns. We may share technical identifiers (like IP address, device information) and event data (like app install, app open) with them. If you grant permission via the App Tracking Transparency prompt, we may also share your device's Advertising Identifier (IDFA) with these partners for these purposes.
- **Analytics Providers** (Google Analytics / Firebase): We use analytics services to understand how users interact with our App. This involves sharing usage data and technical identifiers.
- **Legal Requirements**: We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or government agency).
- **Protection of Rights**: We may disclose information where we believe it necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any person, or as evidence in litigation.

These third parties have their own privacy policies governing how they use the information we share with them. We encourage you to review their policies:

- Google / Firebase: https://policies.google.com/privacy, https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy
- Facebook (Meta): https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/
- TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/legal/privacy-policy

## Tracking Technologies & Advertising

We use Software Development Kits (SDKs) provided by third parties like Google (Firebase), Facebook (Meta), TikTok, and Google Ads. These SDKs allow us to collect information automatically for analytics and advertising measurement purposes as described above. This may involve the use of device identifiers, including Apple's Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA).

### App Tracking Transparency (ATT)

For users on iOS 14.5 and later, we comply with Apple's App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework. We will ask for your permission before tracking your activity across other companies' apps and websites or accessing your device's advertising identifier (IDFA).

- **If you grant permission**: We may collect and share your IDFA with our advertising partners (Facebook, TikTok, Google) for purposes like measuring ad effectiveness and attributing installs.
- **If you deny permission** (or have limited tracking globally): We will not collect or access your IDFA. Our ability to measure ad performance may be limited, but the core functionality of the App remains unaffected.

You can change your tracking preferences for this app or all apps at any time in your device's Settings (usually under Settings > Privacy & Security > Tracking).

## User Rights and Choices

You have certain rights regarding your personal information, subject to local law:

- **Access**: You can access much of your personal information through your account settings in the App.
- **Correction**: You can update and correct your email or display name in the App settings.
- **Deletion**: You can request deletion of your account and associated data through the App's "Delete Account" feature or by contacting us directly. We will process your request in accordance with our Data Retention policy.
- **Data Portability**: You can request a copy of your data in a structured, commonly used format by contacting us.
- **Tracking Preferences**: As described above, you can manage tracking permissions via the ATT prompt and your iOS device settings.

To exercise any of these rights not available directly in the App, please contact us at matthewfbarber@gmail.com.

## Data Retention

We retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you with the App's services and fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy. When you delete your account, we will initiate the deletion of your personal information, typically completing it within 30 days, unless we have a legal obligation or a legitimate business need (like security or fraud prevention) to retain certain data for a longer period. Aggregated or anonymized data may be retained indefinitely for analytics purposes.

## Children's Privacy

FaithTrack is not intended for children under the age of 13 (or the relevant minimum age in your jurisdiction). We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe we have collected information from your child, please contact us immediately at matthewfbarber@gmail.com so we can take steps to remove such information.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or relevant laws. The updated version will be indicated by an updated "Last Updated" date at the top. If we make material changes (e.g., significantly changing how we use or share your data), we will provide notice through the App or by email before the change becomes effective. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.

## California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) / California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). This includes the right to know, delete, correct, and opt-out of the "sale" or "sharing" of your personal information (as defined by CPRA, which may include sharing for cross-context behavioral advertising). To exercise these rights, please contact us using the details provided below. We do not "sell" personal information in the traditional sense, but the use of advertising and analytics technologies may constitute "sharing" under CPRA. You can manage preferences regarding tracking as described in the "App Tracking Transparency (ATT)" section.

## International Data Transfers

Your information, including personal data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those in your jurisdiction (e.g., United States). Our service providers (like Google, Meta, TikTok) may also process data globally. We take steps to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
